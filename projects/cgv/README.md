# CGV-WEB  
**Calorimeter Geometry Viewer – Web**

**CGV-WEB** is the web-based evolution of **CaloGeoView**, a scientific visualization tool originally developed as part of the PhD thesis of **Dr. Prof. Luciano Manhães de Andrade Filho**.

The original CaloGeoView was designed as a **Linux desktop application** capable of visualizing **CERN calorimeter events**, rendering each calorimeter cell and color-coding it according to the energy deposited by passing particles.

This repository represents an effort by **NIPSCERN** to **port and modernize CaloGeoView into an online, platform-independent tool**, making it accessible worldwide through the web at:

**https://nipscern.com/projects/cgv**

CGV-WEB enables:

- Interactive visualization of calorimeter geometries and events  
- Energy-based color mapping of detector cells  
- Global access through modern web technologies  

By moving from a local Linux application to a web-based platform, CGV-WEB expands the reach of high-energy physics visualization tools, supporting education, outreach, and scientific analysis on a global scale.
