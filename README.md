## Projects

### SAPHO (Scalable Architecture Processor for Hardware Optimization)
Our flagship project revolutionizes Processor Soft Cores (PSCs) by introducing dynamic resource allocation. Key features:
- Scalable architecture that adapts to program requirements
- Variable word size optimization
- Dual compiler system:
  - C+− compiler: Converts C subset to Assembly
  - Assembly-to-Verilog compiler: Generates optimized hardware configurations
- Integrated with Aurora IDE for streamlined development

### Aurora IDE
Modern integrated development environment for SAPHO:
- Electron-based interface
- Multiple specialized terminals
- GitHub integration
- AI assistance (ChatGPT and Claude)
- Real-time debugging
- Automated backup system
- Monaco editor integration

### ALICE
New compiler project featuring:
- Abstract Syntax Tree implementation
- Advanced code optimization
- Modern compiler architecture
- [Project under development]

### Helvetia
Documentation hub containing:
- Research papers
- Technical documentation
- Journal publications
- Project documentation
- Academic resources

### Infinity Manager
Windows post-format utility:
- Automated tool installation
- Laboratory software suite setup
- Configuration management
- Time-saving automation features
