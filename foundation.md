# THE ARCHITECT: A Six-Year Construction of the Complete Mind

## Philosophy & Objectives

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Formal Logic:** Comprehensive formation in philosophical logic (deontic, modal, paraconsistent, non-classical, paradoxes) with applications to CERN experimental physics
2. **Informal Logic:** Decision-making framework, bias recognition, argumentation, ethical reasoning for daily life
3. **Cultural Formation:** Non-Eurocentric survey of human cultural production across all domains and epochs
4. **Contribution:** Original work in logic (pure or applied) by year 6

**Constraints:** 4 hours/day × 6 years = ~8,760 hours total  
**Note:** Cultural content (films, music, poetry) consumed passively, reducing mental load
